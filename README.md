# Current Top 10 Countries CO2 Emissions Trends Over The Last 50 Years
# Description
In this project we will use the greenhouse gas emission data set owid-co2-data.csv from Our World in Data to analyze the trends of the leading CO2 emmiting countries over the last 50 years. We will use python to select, eliminate, and analyze desired data to clearly see which countries are the top emitters. We will quickly be able to find that the current top 10 CO2 emitting countries are China, United States, India, Russia, Japan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Germany, Indonesia and South Korea.
# Requirements
The software used to analyze this data is Google Colab; An online platform that allows users to write, run, and share Python code.
